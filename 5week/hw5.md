# Summary of Contributions

I initially attempted to set up the Plane project but encountered an error with the `.\setup.ps1` script. Due to this issue, I decided to switch to a beginner-friendly open-source project, the First Contributions repository. 

## Steps I Followed:

1. **Cloned the Repository**:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\Users\Nath> git clone https://github.com/nathfreires/first-contributions.git
   Cloning into 'first-contributions'...
   remote: Enumerating objects: 94980, done.
   remote: Counting objects: 100% (258/258), done.
   remote: Compressing objects: 100% (107/107), done.
   remote: Total 94980 (delta 170), reused 236 (delta 151), pack-reused 94722 (from 1)
   Receiving objects: 100% (94980/94980), 43.22 MiB | 7.00 MiB/s, done.
   Resolving deltas: 100% (60318/60318), done.
   
2. **Navigated to the Repository Directory**:


```powershell
Copiar código
PS C:\Users\Nath> cd first-contributions

3. **Created a New Branch**:

```powershell
Copiar código
PS C:\Users\Nath\first-contributions> git switch -c add-nathfreires
Switched to a new branch 'add-nathfreires'

**Opened the Code in an IDE: I used VSCode to review and edit the code.**

Reviewed the .env Files: I checked the various .env files available in different folders for the required environment variables.
# I will come back to Plane later and debug more
