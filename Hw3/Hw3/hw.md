# Contributing to Plane

I plan to contribute to **Plane**, an open-source project management tool that serves as an alternative to JIRA, Linear, Monday, and Asana. Plane helps you track your issues, epics, and product roadmaps in the simplest way possible.

## Motivation

I want to work on this project because I believe it will enhance my understanding of product management overall. I plan to join the Discord community soon and become an active participant.

## Project Highlights

What I find particularly exciting about Plane is the opportunity to engage in both coding and non-technical aspects, such as marketing. This mix aligns well with my interests.

## Areas of Contribution

I am interested in working on issues related to the **front-end** aspects of the platform and **content creation**. Here are the primary languages used in the project:

- **TypeScript:** 68.7%
- **Python:** 24.8%
- **HTML:** 4.7%
- **CSS:** 1.2%
- **JavaScript:** 0.3%
- **Shell:** 0.3%

I'm currently becoming more drawn to TypeScript over Python, which makes this very fun for me.

## Guidelines

I will ensure that I am aware of the project's guidelines to avoid overlooking any important aspects. I am confident that this project will provide practical experience and allow me to exercise many of my skills, like marketing, coding skills, and product management. And problem-solving skills!
