# Bio

Hi! My name is **Natanaele Freires**, and I am part of the class of 2025 at **Bennington College**, studying *Computer Science*, *Communications*, and *Mathematics*. I have a strong background in **web development** and **data science**. I decided to take this course because I believe having knowledge in **GitHub** can be very useful when seeking future career opportunities.

# Group Fix

I worked with **Cally** on fixing Website Issue **516** to make the **p5.js** website more responsive. The main issue was that text and elements were getting cut off on smaller screens.

At first, it was tricky to figure out where to startâ€”finding a good first issue, understanding how to build the project, and getting familiar with the code. But once we got the hang of it, the fix itself was relatively straightforward. We experimented with different properties and breakpoints until we found the most effective solution to make the page responsive across devices.

# Solo Fixes

## [4th Solo Fix Report](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/Nath/blob/main/Solo%20Fix/4th%20Solo%20Fix%20Report.md)

I fixed a bug on the **Kubernetes** website where text in **Case Studies** boxes was missing by updating the CSS for proper visibility and styling.

## [5th Solo Fix Report](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/Nath/blob/main/Solo%20Fix/5th%20Solo%20Fix%20Report.md)

I fixed the **search box** issue where the text was hard to read by updating the CSS to make the text color stand out more against the background.

# Learnings

This course has been invaluable in helping me learn essential skills step by step, building a solid foundation for the final project. Before this course, I had never worked with **MDX files** or different libraries for web development. The learning curve was steep, especially when navigating challenges on a **Windows system**. Since many open-source projects have guidelines aimed at **Linux** users, I had to adjust by learning new commands and figuring out how to explore different codebases.

I also developed important **group collaboration skills**. Working on a shared codebase with someone else can be tough, so we had to pick issues we were both comfortable with, track progress, and ensure everything got done. For my solo fixes, I spent a lot of time trying to install and build with **yarn** (similar to npm), but school network proxy issues made it difficult.

Additionally, I learned how to follow **contributing guidelines**, create branches, and use commands to keep the codebase updated. Debugging both **back-end** and **front-end** aspects of the project was a key learning experience. I also became familiar with **pull requests** and the necessary steps for them to be merged into the codebase.

This experience has been incredibly valuable, and now that Iâ€™m more comfortable with **GitHub**, Iâ€™m excited to take on new challenges and contribute to more projects!
