# Bio

Hi! My name is Natanaele Freires, and I am part of the class of 2025 at Bennington College, studying Computer Science, Communications, and Mathematics. I have a strong background in web development and data science. I decided to take this course because I believe having knowledge in GitHub can be very useful when seeking future career opportunities.

# Group Fix

I worked with Cally on fixing Website Issue 516 to make the p5.js website more responsive. The main issue was text and elements getting cut off on smaller screens. 

At first, it was tricky to figure out where to start—finding a good first issue and understanding how to build the project. But once we got the hang of it, the fix itself was pretty straightforward. We experimented with different properties and breakpoints until we found the best solution to make the page responsive across devices.

# Solo Fixes

## [4th Solo Fix Report](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/Nath/blob/main/Solo%20Fix/4th%20Solo%20Fix%20Report.md)

I fixed a bug on the Kubernetes website where text in Case Studies boxes was missing by updating the CSS for proper visibility and styling.

## [5th Solo Fix Report](https://github.com/bennColl-cs4387/Nath/blob/main/Solo%20Fix/5th%20Solo%20Fix%20Report.md)

I fixed the search box issue where the text was hard to read by updating the CSS to make the text color stand out more against the background.

# Learnings

I'm glad this course was designed to guide us through learning necessary skills step by step, building a solid foundation for our solo fixes. Before this course, I had never worked with MDX files or different libraries for web development. The learning curve was steep, especially when it came to navigating challenges on a Windows system. Many open-source projects have guidelines aimed at Linux users, so I had to adjust by learning new commands and figuring out how to explore interesting project codebases.

I also developed group collaboration skills, as working on a shared codebase with someone else can be tough. We had to pick an issue both of us were comfortable with, track the work, and ensure everything could be done. For my solo fixes, I spent a lot of time just trying to install and build with yarn, which is similar to npm, but school network proxy issues made it difficult.

I also learned to follow contributing guidelines, create branches, and use commands to keep the codebase updated. Dealing with errors and debugging both back-end and front-end aspects of the project was a key learning experience. I also got familiar with pull requests and the necessary steps for them to be merged into a codebase.

This experience has been really valuable. Now that I feel more comfortable with GitHub, I’m excited to take on new challenges and contribute to more projects.
