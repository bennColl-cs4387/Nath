# Debugging and Addressing the `/es/reference/p5.sound/` Bug in P5.js

For the [bug #639 on the p5.js website](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-website/issues/639), I decided to focus on resolving the 404 error that occurs when trying to access the `/es/reference/p5.sound/` route. My main goal is to address the issue with routing and ensure the Spanish version of the `p5.sound` page loads correctly. To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity, I focused specifically on fixing this bug without making unrelated changes.

---

## Steps Taken

### **1. Investigating the Missing Spanish Files**

The first issue I discovered was that the `p5.sound` content didn’t exist in the Spanish content directory. To address this, I created a new folder:

```
src/content/reference/es/p5.sound/
```

I copied the `.mdx` files from the English folder (`src/content/reference/en/p5.sound/`) into this new Spanish folder. Then, I updated the frontmatter metadata to reflect the Spanish locale. Below is an example of the changes made:

```yaml
id: "es/reference/p5.sound/loadSound"
title: "Cargar Sonido"
description: "Carga un archivo de sonido en p5.js."
module: "p5.sound"
```

Despite these changes, the 404 error persisted, indicating that the issue wasn’t solely due to missing files.

### **2. Debugging Route Generation**

The project uses the `getStaticPaths` function to generate routes for localized content. I added debugging logs to this function, located in the file `src/pages/[locale]/reference/[...id].astro`, to verify whether the paths for the Spanish `p5.sound` content were being generated. The logs included:

```javascript
console.log(`Generating paths for locale: ${locale}`);
console.log(`Entries for ${locale}:`, localeEntries);
console.log(`Generated path for ${locale}: /${locale}/reference/${normalizedId}`);
```

The logs revealed that no paths were being generated for `/es/reference/p5.sound/`, suggesting that the Spanish `.mdx` files weren’t being processed correctly. This pointed to a deeper issue with the system’s handling of localized metadata or file structure.

---

### **3. Resolving Class Prefix Inconsistencies**

While investigating the documentation for `p5.sound`, I noticed that some class names, such as `Amplitude`, were missing the `p5.` prefix. This inconsistency might be causing additional issues. To address this, I updated the `.mdx` files to include the correct prefix, ensuring the documentation matched the library’s structure:

```yaml
id: "es/reference/p5.sound/p5.Amplitude"
title: "p5.Amplitude"
description: "Analiza la amplitud del sonido en p5.js."
module: "p5.sound"
```


## Challenges and Next Steps

This bug appears to be more complex than initially expected, with other issues associated with this one (Like bug #636). While I have not resolved the 404 error, I have made progress in the debbuging aspect. I also think the documentation for this p5 sound page is not organized well enough like the other pages, making this process even more difficult.

### Challenges:
1. Outdated reference sound files that prevent proper linking of examples.
2. Missing paths in the `getStaticPaths` function for the Spanish `p5.sound` files.
3. Inconsistent metadata across the Spanish and English content files.

### Next Steps:
1. Investigate why the Spanish `.mdx` files are not being processed correctly by `getStaticPaths`.
2. Add a comment to the bug and ask questions that hopefully, once answered, could maybe help me more.
