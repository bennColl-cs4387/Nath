## Issue Description

The issue [Search box unusable due to colors](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/8653) highlighted user confusion when interacting with the search bar. The bug was caused by the typed text color being nearly identical to the background color, making it almost impossible to read what was written.

## Solution

To resolve this, the CSS file located in the `examples/_next/static/css` directory was updated. The modified code is as follows:

```css
.dCAWTi {
    font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 1px solid;
    color: rgb(245, 245, 245); /* Enhanced text visibility */
    transition: 100ms;
    appearance: none;
}
```

## Status

A pull request is currently being prepared to implement this fix.
