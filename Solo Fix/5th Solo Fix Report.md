## Issue Description

The issue "[Search box unusable due to colors](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/8653)" highlighted user confusion when interacting with the search bar. The problem arose because the typed text color closely matched the background color, making almost impossible to read what was written.
## Solution

To resolve this, the CSS file located in the `examples/_next/static/css` directory was updated. The modified code is as follows:

```css
.dCAWTi {
    font-family: Inter, sans-serif;
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: 1px solid;
    color: rgb(245, 245, 245); /* Enhanced text visibility */
    transition: 100ms;
    appearance: none;
}
```

## Status

A pull request is currently being prepared to implement this fix.
