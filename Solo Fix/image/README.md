### What Was the Problem? (1st image)
The search box wasn’t working as expected because the text you typed in was practically invisible! For example, in the first image, I typed "hello," but you can't see it because the text color was almost the same as the background.

I highlighted the area, and now you can finally see what was written. This is not great for usability and accessibility.

After the fix, the text color was updated to ensure it’s visible against the background. Now you can clearly see what you’re typing without having to add extra effort.
